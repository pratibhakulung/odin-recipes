    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>
      My husband and I went crazy over a blueberry smoothie at a local cafe.
      This was our attempt to recreate it...but we actually like it better than
      the original!
    </p>

    <strong>Ingridents</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup frozen blueberries</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen strawberries</li>
      <li>1 cup pineapple and orange juice blend</li>
      <li>1 cup vanilla yogurt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
      <li>6 ice cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Steps</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the blueberries, strawberries, juice, yogurt and sugar into the
        container of a blender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ice cubes, and process until small enough to fit through a
        straw, but large enough to crunch on.
      </li>
      <li>Pour into glasses, and drink through straws.</li>
    </ol>
